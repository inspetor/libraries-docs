# Inspetor Antifraud
Antrifraud Inspetor library for Android.

[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/theosato/inspetor-android/inspetor/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/theosato/inspetor-android/inspetor/_latestVersion)

## Description
Inspetor is an product developed to help your company to avoid fraudulent transactions. This READ ME file should help you to integrate the Inspetor PHP library into your product with a couple steps. 

P.S.: the library was made in Kotlin and all of the code you'll see here is Kotlin as well.

## Demo
If you think that this tutorial and whatever you saw 'til now wasn't clear enough, maybe you need some hand's on. Thinking about that, our team builded an Demo App to test our library and you can clone from [here](https://github.com/inspetor/inspetor-android-demo-app). You'll find all of our tracker requests and how to instantiante our library with the best practices. Good luck!

## Setup Guide
This is the step-by-step Inspetor integration:

### Library Repositories
When we build an Android library, the most professional way of publish it to multiple clients is upload the library into some known libraries repository as ***Jitpack***, ***JCenter***,  and ***Nexus***. Our stable versions will be into Nexus. Doing that, it's extremely easy to import our library into your project. Take a look in these 2 steps: 
1) Add this line into your root build.gradle at the end of repositories (if it's not there yet):
```
allprojects {
  repositories {
      ...
    	mavenCentral()
    }
}
```
The "mavenCentral" call says that your project will be able to use libraries hosted into Nexus repository.


2) Then add this dependency:
```
dependencies {
  ...
  implementation 'com.github.inspetor:inspetor:[version]@aar', { transitive = true }
  (e.g. 'com.github.inspetor:inspetor:1.2.1@aar')
}
 ```
It means you're importing our Inspetor arctifact from Nexus repo into your project. The **transitive** statement says that the library will be imported with it dependencies. It's really important, so ***don't forget it***!

With these 2 steps, you're already able to use our nice code! Let's try? 

### Library setup
You must provide your config to setup our library. To do that, we created a data class called InspetorConfig (duh) and you just have to do something like that:

```
  var config = InspetorConfig(trackerName, appId, devEnv)
  (e.g. InspetorConfig("cool.name", "ID123", true))
```

The ***"appId"*** is an unique identifier that the awesome Inspetor Team will provide you when you start to pay us. The ***"trackerName"*** is a name that will help us to find your data in our database and we'll provide you a couple of them. The ***"devEnv"*** is a boolean statement that you set to say if you want to use the develoment environment or prod. It's false by default. Okay, if you did everything right until now, you're really able to call our functions and to begin your fight against fraudulent transactions with us.

The whole code to instantiate our lib is gonna be like:
```
  val inspetor = InspetorClient()
  inspetor.setup(InspetorConfig("inspetor.test", "123", true))
  inspetor.collect(this)
```
After that, you can use all of our tracking methods without errors. We have a section in our [general files]() to explain a little more of each function you'll see here, but don't worry too much right now. These are our first steps together, right?

Ok, but we'll start to code for real now, so we **strongly** recommend you to create an InspetorManager object (*like a **Singleton***). We trully believe that it's better if you call our library as a singleton to avoid instantiate the same class and trackers many times per user. At the same time, with a singleton as the one bellow, you keep the 2 setup functions together and you can call just one function that does all initialization in your classes and don't have to pass config everytime. Confusing? Relax, we're kind enough to show you how to do it.

```
  package com.android.yourapplication

  import android.content.Context
  import com.inspetor.*

  object InspetorManager {
      var config = InspetorConfig("inspetor.android", "1234", true)
      var inspetor: InspetorClient = InspetorClient()

      fun setup(context: Context) {
          inspetor.setup(config)
          inspetor.collect(context)
      }

      fun getClient(): InspetorClient {
          return this.inspetor
      }
  }
```

Now, wherever you need to call some Inspetor function, you just need to import this Class, get the client and _voil√†_.

### Library Calls

I'm supposing you did an amazing job until this moment, so let's move on. It's time to make some calls and track some data. Nice, huh? Here we go.

If you've already read the [general Inspetor files](https://inspetor.github.io/slate/#introduction), you should be aware of all of Inspetor requests and trackers, so our intention here is just to show you how to use the Kotlin version of one of them. You'll see it's so, so, so, so easy that one request will be enough. 

Let's imagine that you want to put a tracker in your *"create transaction"* flow to send some data that the best Antifraud team should analyze and tell you if it's a fraud or not. So, it's intuitive that you need to call the *inspetorSaleCreation* and pass the data of that sale, right?

Yeah, it's exactly that and that's how you do it! 

```
package com.android.yourapplication

import ...

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
        
        InspetorManager.setup(this) // I'm supposing you're using the singleton we've talking, ok?
  }
  
  @OnLifecycleEvent(Lifecycle.Event.ON_RESUME)
  override fun onResume() {
        super.onResume()
        ...
        if (sale_id != null && InspetorManager.inspetor.isConfigured()) {
          InspetorManager.inspetor.trackSaleCreation(sale_id)
        }
        ...
  }

```

Following this code and assuming you've builded your singleton carefully, it'll send an request to us saying that a sale with this sale_id was created and we'll be able to join with more data with the same sale_id sent by the [banckend trackers](). 

### Models

If you're some poor full stack developer and had to set your backend with some Inspetor backend library, first I should say that I know your pain. Second: models don't exist here. You can notice that all of the trackers funtions has only one parameter and it's a simple string, so... Forget the models!

### Conclusion
WOW! It was lovely to work with you, my friend. We trully hope that our instructions were clear and effective. Again, please tell us if we could make something better and contact us [here]().

Now you're invited to join our army against fraud 'cause ***STEALING IS BULLSHIT***!

*DPCL (dope cool)*
