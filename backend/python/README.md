# Inspetor Antifraud
Antrifraud Inspetor library for Python.

## Description
Inspetor is an product developed to help your company to avoid fraudulent transactions. This READ ME file should help you to integrate the Inspetor Python library into your product with a couple steps.

## Setup Guide
This is the step-by-step Inspetor integration:

### PiPY
PyPI is, in fact, the largest Python code repository we have. It's common to install python libraries with "pip install" command. That's why we did the same. To install our library, you just have to type: 
```
pip install inspetor
```
If you get no errors, you'll be able to see the inspetor version installed using "pip freeze" command (will show every library you've installed in your environment). 

### Library setup
Now you're almost able to call our beautiful library inside your code. But, first, you need to set some **configuration**. To Inspetor avoid your fraud, you only need to provide us **three things**: *"appId"*, *"trackerName"*, *"devEnv"* like that:
```
    inspetor_config = {
        "APP_ID":"123",
        "TRACKER_NAME":"123",
        "DEV_ENV":True
    }
```

The ***"appId"*** is an unique identifier that the awesome Inspetor Team will provide you when you start to pay us. The ***"trackerName"*** is a name that will help us to find your data in our database and we'll provide you a couple of them. The ***"devEnv"*** is a boolean statement that you set to say if you want to use the develoment environment or prod. It's false by default. Okay, if you did everything right until now, you're really able to call our functions and to begin your fight against fraudulent transactions with us.

We'll gonna code for real now, so we **strongly** recommend you to create an Inspetor class in your code to start our library. There's where you gonna insert Inspetor config you wrote some lines above and retrieve our client. Confusing? Relax, we're kind enough to show you how to do it.

```
import inspetor

class InspetorClass:

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Let's instantiate this awesome library!
        """
        self.inspetor = InspetorClient(inspetor_config)

    def get_client(self):
        """
        return Inspetor\InspetorClient client
        """
        return self.inspetor
  ...
```

Now, wherever you need to call some Inspetor function, you just need to import this Class and _voilÃ _.

*P.S.: you can place your config wherever you think is better, just before instantiate InspetorClient or into a config file that you include in this class.

### Library Calls

I'm supposing you did an amazing job until this moment, so let's move on. It's time to make some calls and track some data. Nice, huh? Here we go.

If you've already read the [general Inspetor files](https://inspetor.github.io/slate/#introduction), you should be aware of all of Inspetor requests and trackers, so our intention here is just to show you how to use the PHP version of some of them.

Let's imagine that you want to put a tracker in your *"create transaction"* flow to send some data that the best Antifraud team should analyze and tell you if it's a fraud or not. So, it's intuitive that you need to call the *inspetorSaleCreation* and pass the data of that sale, right?

Yeah, but we must ask you a little favor. Considering the fraud context, it's possible that not all of your transaction data
help us to indenfity fraud, so we created a **Model** for each instance we use (remember what is a Model [here](https://inspetor.github.io/slate/#models)) that you must build and fill with it's needed. Let's see a snippet.

```
from niceCompany.inspetor.inspetor_class import InspetorClass;

class Sale:
  ...

  def some_company_function(self): 
      """
      company_sale is an example object of the company with sale data
      """
      inspetor_sale = self.inspetorSaleBuilder(company_sale)

      self.inspetor = InspetorClass

      if inspetor_sale is not None:
          inspetor.get_client.track_sale_creation(inspetor_sale)

  def inspetor_sale_builder(self, company_sale):
  
      model = inspetor.get_client.get_inspetor_sale()

      model.id(company_sale.get_id());
      model.account_id(company_sale.user_id)
      model.status(company_sale.sale_status);
      model.is_fraud($company_sale.fraud);
      model....

      return model
  ...
```

Following this code and assuming you've builded your model with all required parametes (find out each Model's required parameters [here](https://inspetor.github.io/slate/#models)), we *someCompanyFunction* run, the Inspetor code inside will send a great object with all we need to know about that sale. Easy?

We're using an auxiliar function *inspetorSaleBuilder* to build the *Sale Model* but you don't have to do it, or place it where we do here neither. You could set this *inspetorSaleBuilder* inside your *InspetorClass* that we talked about some lines above, for example. More tips in the section Best Practices & Tips.

### Models

The last snipped was a simple example to show how you should call our library and build one of our models. But now we're gonna talk about all of our Models, hoping you understand that some of them are not tracked it self but it's needed inside others. Take a look!



***Principal models***:
- **Auth**: model you fill with ***login*** or ***logout*** data. The name came from "*Authentication*".
```
  """
  Calling an instance of Model
  """
  inspetor_auth = self.inspetor.get_inspetor_auth()

  """
  Filling model with auth data
  """
  inspetor_auth.account_email = "test@email.com"
  inspetor_auth.succeeded = datetime.timestamp(datetime.now())
  inspetor_auth.timestamp = True // True when login works
```

- **Account**: model you fill with your ***user*** data. Account has *address* and *billing_address* as two non required values and both are builded with *Address* Model.
```
  """
  Calling an instance of Model
  """
  inspetor_account = self.inspetor.get_inspetor_account();

  """
  Filling model with account data
  """
  inspetor_account.id = "123"
  inspetor_account.name = "Test"
  inspetor_account.email = "test@email.com"
  inspetor_account.document = "12312312312"
  inspetor_account.phoneNumber = "112345678"
  inspetor_account.address = inspetor_account_address
  inspetor_account.timestamp = datetime.timestamp(datetime.now())
```

- **Event**: model you fill with your ***event*** data (e.g. an party or forum info). The *address* is required here, so you **must** instantiate an *Address* Model to an Event.
```
  """
  Calling an instance of Model
  """
  inspetor_event = self.inspetor.get_inspetor_event()

  """
  Filling model with event data
  """
  inspetor_event.id = "123"
  inspetor_event.name = "Name Test"
  inspetor_event.description = "Description Test"
  inspetor_event.sessions = [
      inspetor_event_session1,
      inspetor_event_session1
  ]
  inspetor_event.status = "private"
  inspetor_event.slug = "slug-test"
  inspetor_event.creator_id = "124"
  inspetor_event.is_physical = True
  inspetor_event.categories = [
      inspetor_event_category1,
      inspetor_event_category2
  ]
  inspetor_event.address = inspetor_event_address
  inspetor_event.admins_id = ["123"]
  inspetor_event.seating_options = ["Seating Option"]
  inspetor_event.timestamp = datetime.timestamp(datetime.now())
```

- **PassRecovery**: model that must contain data from a ***password recovery*** or ***password reset*** request of your API.
```
  """
  Calling an instance of Model
  """
  inspetor_pass = self.inspetor.get_inspetor_pass_recovery()

  """
  Filling model with password recovery data
  """
  inspetor_pass.recovery_email = "test@email.com"
  inspetor_pass.timestamp = datetime.timestamp(datetime.now())
```

- **Sale**: model that should be filled with the ***sale*** data you have in your API. The sale status has fixed allowed values:
  - "accepted"
  - "rejected"
  - "pending"
  - "refunded"
  - "manual_analysis"
```

  """
  Calling an instance of Model
  """
  inspetor_sale = self.inspetor.get_inspetor_sale()

  """
  Filling model with sale data
  """
  inspetor_sale.id = "123"
  inspetor_sale.account_id = "456"
  inspetor_sale.total_value = "123,00"
  inspetor_sale.status = "pending"
  inspetor_sale.timestamp = datetime.timestamp(datetime.now())
  inspetor_sale.items = [
      self.get_default_item()
  ]
  inspetor_sale.payment = inspetor_payment
?>
```

- **Transfer**: model you fill with ***transference*** data of an item of your API (e.g. transfer of a ticket). The transfer status has fixed allowed values:
  - "accepted"
  - "rejected"
  - "pending"
```
  """
  Calling an instance of Model
  """
  inspetor_transfer = self.inspetor.get_inspetor_transfer()

  """
  Filling model with transfer data
  """
  transfer.id = "123"
  transfer.timestamp = datetime.timestamp(datetime.now())
  transfer.item_id = "123"
  transfer.sender_account_id = "123"
  transfer.receiver_email = "test@email.com"
  transfer.status = "pending"
```

***Auxiliar models***:
- **Address**: this model appears inside Account and Event models and should be filled with data of an ***user***, ***credit card**** or an ***event***.
```
  """
  Calling an instance of Model
  """
  inspetor_address = self.inspetor.get_inspetor_address()

  """
  Filling model with address data
  """
  inspetor_address.street = "Test Stree"
  inspetor_address.number = "123"
  inspetor_address.zip_code = "123456"
  inspetor_address.city = "Test City"
  inspetor_address.state = "Test State"
  inspetor_address.country = "Test Country"
  inspetor_address.latitude = "123"
  inspetor_address.longitude = "123"
```
- **CreditCard**: when your API process a payment done with credit card, this model will be used. It should be filled with ***buyer's creditcard*** secure data. We don't hold all information at all.
```
  """
  Calling an instance of Model
  """
  inspetor_cc = self.inspetor.get_inspetor_card()

  """
  Filling model with credit card data
  """
  credit_card.first_six_digits = "123456"
  credit_card.last_four_digits = "1234"
  credit_card.holder_name = "Holder Name Test"
  credit_card.holder_cpf = "Holder CPF Test"
  credit_card.billing_address = inspetor_billing_address
```

- **Item**: when someone buy a ***ticket*** for instance, this Model will be instantiate and filled with that ticket data.
```
  """
  Calling an instance of Model
  """
  inspetor_item = self.inspetor.get_inspetor_item()

  """
  Filling model with item data
  """
  inspetor_item.id = "123"
  inspetor_item.event_id = "123"
  inspetor_item.session_id = "123"
  inspetor_item.seating_option = "Seating Option Test"
  inspetor_item.price = "10"
  inspetor_item.quantity = "123"
```

- **Payment**: this is a Model that holds the ***transaction*** data (e.g. payment method or installments). The payment status has fixed allowed values:
  - "credit_card" but you can use the Payment const like Payment::CREDIT_CARD
  - "boleto" but you can use the Payment const like Payment::BOLETO
  - "other" but you can use the Payment const like Payment::OTHER_METHOD
```
  """
  Calling an instance of Model
  """
  inspetor_payment = self.inspetor.get_inspetor_payment()

  """
  Filling model with payment data
  """
  payment.id = "123"
  payment.method = "credit_card"
  payment.installments = "1"
  payment.credit_card = inspetor_credit_card
```

 - **Session**: model you fill with ***event date session*** data.
```
  """
  Calling an instance of Model
  """
  inspetor_session = self.inspetor.get_inspetor_session()

  """
  Filling model with session data
  """
  inspetor_session.id = "123"
  inspetor_session.datetime = int(1562934682) // it's the date of that event session in unix timestamp format
?>
```

 - **Category**: model you fill with ***event category*** data. In event context it could be, for instance "Show", "Lecture", "Art Exposition", etc.
```
  """
  Calling an instance of Model
  """
  inspetor_category = self.inspetor.get_inspetor_category()

  """
  Filling model with category data
  """
  category.id = "123"
  category.name = "Cooltegory"
?>
```

### What you should notice
Not all of the Model's attributes are required but we trully recommend you work around to pass them all. On the other hand, some of them are **super important** and you should pass it correctly. Let's talk about some of them.
 - Sale:
   - ***is_fraud***: it's an attribute that you **must** pass to indicate that a sale is fraudulent or not even if it's something that we're providing to you (as part of postback process).
 - Event:
   - ***sessions***: it's an attribute that you **must** pass even if you don't use the sessions context. If is that the case, you just need to replicate some of you Event attribute, as *event_id* and *event_date* for example.
 - Address:
   - ***almost all fields***: address is **only required** when you try to track an Event, but exists in Account model as well. The tricky is that once you decide to provide an Address, most of the atributes are required and you'll get a lot of Exceptions if try to pass it incomplete.
 - CreditCard:
   - ***all fields***: all of them are requested once you set that the *payment_method* as "credit_card", so pay attention to that.
 - Common requests:
   - ***timestamp***: some Models have setters and getters to timestamp as you can see in the general files, and you must provide us a unix timestamp.

### Best Practices & Tips
Did you think it was easy? Please tell us and feel free to send suggestions [here](), we really would appreciate that. From now on, we decided to tell you some ~~secrets~~ nice practices we discover during development time and should help you with a cleaner integration.
  - **InspetorClass**: we already told you about that but it's important. Do it! With this class, you don't need to pass our config everytime and creates a layer between our application and yours, where you can, for instance, create funcions as *modelsBuilders* (we've already talked about that too) to keep all builders in one place. Here's a snippet of InspetorClass like that old before but with an example of *builder*.
```
import inspetor

class InspetorClass:

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Let's instantiate this awesome library!
        """
        self.inspetor = InspetorClient(inspetor_config)

    def get_client(self):
        """
        return Inspetor\InspetorClient client
        """
        return self.inspetor

    def inspetorAuthBuilder(self, auth_data) {
    """
    param  array auth_data
    return Inspetor\Model\Auth
    """
        inspetor_auth = self.get_client.get_inspetor_auth()
        inspetor_auth.account_email = auth_data.user_email
        inspetor_auth.succeeded = auth_data.succeeded_login
        inspetor_auth.timestamp = datetime.timestamp(datetime.now())

        return inspetor_auth
  ...
```

### Conclusion
WOW! It was lovely to work with you, my friend. We trully hope that our instructions were clear and effective. Again, please tell us if we could make something better and contact us [here]().

Now you're invited to join our army against fraud 'cause ***STEALING IS BULLSHIT***!
